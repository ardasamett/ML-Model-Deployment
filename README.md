# Project: Salary Prediction 

When you enter your year of experience, it calculates your estimated salary using a machine learning model.


## What's in the Project?

With the "create_model.py" file, you can create your machine learning model in the "models" folder as "model.pkl"

With the "app.py" file, you can create a Flask app, import the model you have created, specify the links, and even create a basic API.

With the "request.py" file, you can access the API service you created in the "app.py" file.

If you deploy the entire project to Heroku it will work without any problem

**You can visit the live project on [This Heroku App](https://predict-my--salary.herokuapp.com/)**
